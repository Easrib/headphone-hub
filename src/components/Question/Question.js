                <h2>What is the difference between State and Props</h2>
                <p ><ul>
                    <li>State is internal and props are external</li>
                    <li>State is can be modified but props can not be modified</li>

                <h2>How useState work?</h2>
                <p>useState is a hook which empowers the function component. It contains two inner function. One is state and another is setState. state consists the initial value where setState change the initial value. We can declare one or more state variables in function components using useState hooks. This hooks declare a state, access and read the state and update the state.</p>
